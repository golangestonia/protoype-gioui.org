title: Gio UI
subtitle: Cross-Platform GUI for Go
---

Gio implements portable immediate mode GUI programs in Go. Gio programs run on
all the major platforms: iOS/tvOS, Android, Linux (Wayland/X11), macOS,
Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and experimental support for browsers (Webassembly/WebGL).
There is a [unikernel port](https://eliasnaur.com/unik) for running Gio programs in virtual machines.

Gio includes an efficient vector renderer based on the Pathfinder project (https://github.com/servo/pathfinder),
implemented on OpenGL ES and Direct3D 11.
Text and other shapes are rendered using only their outlines without baking them into texture images,
to support efficient animations, transformed drawing and pixel resolution independence.

This is a screenshot of the [Kitchen
example](https://git.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio-example/tree/main/kitchen/kitchen.go). If your browser
supports WebAssembly and WebGL, run the example by pressing the run
button.

## Documentation

The [architecture
document](/doc/architecture) is a good introduction to Gio concepts
and API.

The [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/example) give a feel of the
structure of typical Gio programs.

Jon Strand's [tutorial](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/) is an great
step-by-step guide to writing Gio programs.

The ["Immediate Mode GUI Programming"](https://eliasnaur.com/blog/immediate-mode-gui-programming)
article compares Gio's immediate mode design with the traditional
retained mode APIs such as the browser DOM.

# Reference documentation

[Operations](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/op) and stateful operation
lists are the low-level primitives of Gio. The important operations
are for [drawing](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/op/paint) and
[clipping](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/op/clip), as well as
[pointer](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/io/pointer) and
[keyboard](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/io/key) input.

The [layout](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/layout) package implements
useful layouts, while the [widget](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/widget)
and [widget/material](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/widget/material)
packages implement common user interface widgets. The
[gesture](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/gesture) package detects common
gestures from lower-level input events.

Layouts, widgets and gestures are all implemented in terms of operations.

Package [app](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/app) is for creating
windows and apply operations to them. Only the app package and its
sub-packages have native dependencies, making Gio [highly
portable](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/example/glfw).

## Installation

Gio is designed to work with very few dependencies. It depends only on the platform libraries for
window management, input and GPU drawing.

- [Linux](/doc/install#linux)
- [macOS, iOS, tvOS](/doc/install#apple)
- [Windows](/doc/install#windows)
- [Android](/doc/install#android)
- [WebAssembly](/doc/install#wasm)

Gio supports the latest released version of
[Go](https://golang.org/dl) in module mode. Earlier versions of Go and
GOPATH mode might work, but no effort is made to keep them working.

## Running Gio programs

Use the `go` tool to initialize a new module and run the "hello"
example:

	$ go mod init example.com
	$ go run gioui.org/example/hello

should display a simple message in a window.

The command

	$ go run gioui.org/example/kitchen

is another example that demonstrates the material design widgets.

## Running on mobiles

For Android, iOS, tvOS the `gogio` tool can build and package a Gio program for you.

To build an Android .apk file from the `kitchen` example:

	$ go run gioui.org/cmd/gogio -target android gioui.org/example/kitchen

To build for the iOS simulator:

	$ go run gioui.org/cmd/gogio -target ios -appid <bundle-id> gioui.org/example/kitchen

See the [running on mobile](/doc/mobile) page for more information.


## Webassembly/WebGL

To run a Gio program in a compatible browser, the `gogio` tool can output a directory ready to
serve. With the `goexec` tool you don't even need a web server:

	$ go run gioui.org/cmd/gogio -target js gioui.org/example/kitchen
	$ go get github.com/shurcooL/goexec
	$ goexec 'http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.FileServer(http.Dir("kitchen")))'

Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser to run the program.
